Changes from WebKit1 to WebKit2
===============================

+ Source view is not available anymore (the inspector should be sufficient)

+ Scrolling and toggling scrollbars visbility are done using JavaScript.

 	This a workaround until we find a way to access the GtkScrolledWindow
	from the WebKitWebView, maybe using Web Extensions.

+ The cookie handling is now done by the WebKitCookieManager.

	We still decide the accepting policy and where they are stored.

+ The proxy handling is entirely done by libsoup and we have no control over it.

	You can set *_proxy env parameters or configure it globally in Gnome3.
